INTRODUCTION
------------

The Execute feature has been removed from the Devel module for Drupal 8 since
version 1.3. This module re-adds back that feature as an external module.

Go to the "Execute PHP Code" page (/devel/php), either using the Admin Toolbar
Tools module or using the Devel toolbar (see configuration section) or using the
Devel menu.

There is also a block you can place on your page if needed.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:
 * Devel (https://www.drupal.org/project/devel)


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install and enable this module like any other drupal 8 module.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The module has no settings or configuration.

Otherwise it uses configuration from the Devel module:
 * On Devel configuration page (/admin/config/development/devel), in
   "Variables Dumper", you can choose how the output will behave.
 * On Devel toolbar configuration page
   (/admin/config/development/devel/toolbar), you can enable "Execute PHP"
   menu link.
