# DDEV Drupal Template With Attached VSCode
The tools inside this repository will create a modified Drupal environment, focused on development and debugging.

**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION - This is a local development tool!**
## Quick-Start
**Spin up a ready-to-code Drupal 10/11 CMS DDEV based development container with preconfigured Drupal Best-Practice Dev-Modules and Visual Studio Code Settings/Extensions in three commands!** üöÄ

May take ~5 min - only needed once, at initialization.

Quickly startup a **standard** dev environment using Drupal 10, meant to be used for testing and working on contrib modules / issues:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/webksde/ddev-vscode-devcontainer-drupal-template.git standard-vscode-drupal && cd standard-vscode-drupal && ddev drowl-init
~~~
or startup a **core** dev environment using gitified Drupal 11.x-dev, meant to be used for working on core issues:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/webksde/ddev-vscode-devcontainer-drupal-template.git core-vscode-drupal && cd core-vscode-drupal && ddev drowl-init-dev
~~~
Tipps:
- "ddev-vscode-drupal" can be replaced with any project name of your liking.
  - **Note**, that:
    - Project names need to be **valid**. Valid project names are: "no-spaces-but-hyphens", "UpperAndLower", "should.work.with.dots".
    - The ddev containers will be generated based of your chosen name.
- You can also initiate:
  - A Drupal dev environment (for working on drupal core issues) using `ddev drowl-init-dev`.

## Prerequisites
  1. Up to date Version of DDEV, Docker, Chrome/Firefox
  2. VSCode installed on your machine locally
  3. The [Remote Development Extension for VSCode (extension name: ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
  4. (Optional) To debug inside the attached VS-Code instance, run `ddev config global --xdebug-ide-location=container`
     1.  Unfortunately, this option is only available globally, so you need to adjust your xdebug ide location, when working with other ddev instances, where VSCode is not attached to the web container (e.g., when running the IDE in wsl instead of a container run `ddev config global --xdebug-ide-location=wsl2`).

---

## How to use
 1. Create a project folder and switch into it: `mkdir project-folder && cd project-folder`
 2. Clone the repository into the just created folder: `git clone git@github.com:webksde/ddev-vscode-devcontainer-drupal-template.git .`
 3. Use `ddev drowl-init` to directly start up the environment using Drupal 10 with VSCode / Drupal Best Practice Tools
 4. You are ready to go! Use `ddev describe` to check the status & URLs of your Project and `ddev code` to run your prepared VSCode IDE!
    1. Note, when inside the attached VSCode go to "Extensions" and type in "@recommended" to reveal all the necessary Extensions. Installing them is recommended!

## Typical Use-Cases:
 - Local Drupal development / testing / evaluation instance from scratch or existing with ready-to-go IDE
 - Module / Theme development or evaluation
 - Contrib module issue forks / merge requests / patch creation (Git clone / commit / push / ...)
 - Simple & quick Drupal 10 Sandbox for offline / local

## Documentation
### Tooling
 - Use `ddev code` to attach VSCode to your running Container.
 - Use `ddev phpunit path/to/tests` to Test Classes using PHPUnit.
 - Use `ddev phpunit-coverage path/to/cover` to create a test coverage of the given file-directory.
 - Use `ddev phpcs path/to/sniff` to check your Code using Drupal Coding Standards.
 - Use `ddev phpstan path/to/execute` to look for deprecated and 'dirty' code.
 - Use `ddev eslint path/to/sniff (--fix)` for linting / auto-fixing javascript code based on Drupal Coding Standards.
 - Use `ddev stylelint web/modules/custom/my_module` for linting css files based on Drupal Coding Standards.
 - Use `ddev xdebug on` to turn on xdebug, then in VSCode go to 'Run and Debug', 'Listen for XDebug' and open your Project in the Browser.
 - Use `ddev import-db --target-db=db --src=db.sql.gz` to import a database file.
 - Use `ddev drowl-reset-db` to reset the database to its state after initial startup.
 - Use `ddev dump-db ddev` to dump your main database tablewise.
 - Use `ddev deploy-db ddev` to import your tablewise dump.
  - Note: You can additionally add remote SSH projects under .ddev/commands/web/db-targets

### Delete the environment:
 1. `ddev delete -y` deletes the container and unlists the project.
 2. Delete the project folder

## FAQ / Troubleshooting:
### *How do I install ddev?*

See https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation
We recommend to use *brew* for all kinds of installation, as it's easy to install and update

### *How do I update dddev?*

See above. For brew simply use `brew update && brew upgrade`

### *I can not execute the custom "ddev drowl-init" command*

Make sure you have the newest ddev and docker version and try restarting docker first. If the problem still persists, make sure you do not have two ddev projects with the same name!
If there are no duplicate ddev projects, there might have been a ddev project with the same name in the past, which was not properly deleted using `ddev delete`. Check your Docker Container instances and delete the old Docker Cluster.

### *I used "ddev drowl-init-from-existing" and now my Web-Server can't reach the Database*

We are currently investigating this problem. It has something todo with ddev creating a new database when importing a database dump through their db command. In the meantime you can use `ddev drowl-init` and import your database dump after initialisation through PHPMyAdmin (and swap the composer.json).
